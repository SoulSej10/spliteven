/**
 * A soft fade toward the screen's own background color, used two places:
 *  - `edge="bottom"`: layered above the very bottom of a scrollable screen
 *    that uses the floating tab bar. The tab bar floats as an island
 *    (`left/right: 20`, rounded corners) rather than spanning edge-to-edge,
 *    so content can otherwise be glimpsed passing behind/beside it
 *    mid-scroll with a hard, unpolished cutoff. This eases that transition.
 *  - `edge="left"`/`edge="right"`: on a horizontally-scrolling row that
 *    overflows the screen (PillTabs, once there are enough tabs to not all
 *    fit), so a partially-visible tab at either edge - the first tab
 *    scrolled past on the left, or the last one not yet reached on the
 *    right - reads as "more to scroll to" instead of looking like broken,
 *    mid-word-truncated content.
 *
 * Built from stacked flat bands rather than a true gradient (no
 * linear-gradient native module in this project) - with 10 bands the
 * banding isn't perceptible at normal viewing distance. Purely decorative -
 * `pointerEvents="none"` so it never intercepts touches meant for the
 * content underneath.
